# World Happiness Data Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes the World Happiness Report dataset to explore correlations between various factors such as GDP per capita and social support with happiness scores across different countries. The analysis highlights regional differences and identifies significant trends and outliers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Happiness Report, which includes various indicators for countries, such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and happiness scores.

Key Findings:
Scandinavian countries, including Denmark, Finland, and Norway, tend to have high GDP per capita and happiness scores.
A strong correlation (0.78) exists between social support and happiness scores.
Venezuela serves as an outlier with low GDP per capita but a relatively high happiness score of 4.95.
